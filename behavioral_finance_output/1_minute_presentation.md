## 🎯 SCRIPT (Read at comfortable pace)

### **0:00 - 0:30: What This System Does**

"Hello! Today I'm presenting a **Behavioral Finance Analysis System** built with SpoonOS that tests whether market conditions drive panic behavior among traders.

The system uses a **4-agent research pipeline**: First, a Market Reality Agent analyzes real-time crypto data. Second, a Narrative Analysis Agent identifies market sentiment as FUD, HYPE, or NEUTRAL. Third, a Behavioral Simulation Agent models how Panic Sellers versus Smart Money would react. Finally, a Hypothesis Validation Agent provides a scientific verdict.

The output is a comprehensive visual dashboard with market gauges, sentiment analysis, and behavioral simulation results that delivers actionable insights for both academic research and trading applications."

### **0:30 - 0:45: SpoonOS Strengths**

"This system leverages SpoonOS's three core strengths: **StateGraph orchestration** manages the 4 specialized agents with shared memory and ensures coherent data flow. **MCP integration** standardizes tool interfaces, enabling seamless crypto API connections. And **Web3 data integration** provides real-time blockchain analytics from multiple sources like OKX and DeFi protocols.

SpoonOS transforms complex multi-agent coordination into a streamlined, production-ready system."

### **0:45 - 1:00: Research Context & Results**

"In our recent ETH analysis, the system detected HYPE sentiment with the price at $3,676. The simulation showed Panic Buyers entering due to FOMO, while Smart Money took profits. The scientific verdict: **Hypothesis REJECTED** - no panic behavior detected.

This represents a breakthrough for behavioral finance research, providing scientific rigor to market psychology studies and giving traders a psychological edge through real-time sentiment analysis. The entire system is open-source and ready for academic research or commercial deployment.

Thank you!"
