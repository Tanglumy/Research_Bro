    "summary": "The current literature examining the impact of sleep deprivation on decision making primarily focuses on general cognitive performance, risk assessment, and judgment, with a growing body of research indicating that inadequate sleep impairs executive functioning and increases susceptibility to risky choices. However, studies explicitly addressing decision making under conditions of uncertainty remain limited. Most existing work investigates either the effects of sleep deprivation on decision quality or the cognitive processes underlying uncertainty, but rarely the intersection of these domains. This fragmentation has resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding how sleep loss specifically alters decision strategies when outcomes are ambiguous or unpredictable.\n\nTheoretical perspectives in this area often draw from dual-process models, which distinguish between intuitive, heuristic-based (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) thinking. Sleep deprivation is theorized to impair System 2 processes, thereby increasing reliance on automatic or impulsive responses, which may be particularly detrimental in uncertain contexts. Additionally, theories of risk sensitivity and the somatic marker hypothesis have been used to explain observed shifts in risk-taking behavior following sleep loss, suggesting that impaired emotional regulation and feedback processing may underlie poor decision outcomes.\n\nMethodologically, research in this field frequently employs standardized self-report tools such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess sleep deprivation, alongside behavioral tasks like the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire (MDMQ) to measure decision-making performance. Instruments such as the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) and Uncertainty Response Scale (URS) are less commonly integrated, resulting in a fragmented operationalization of uncertainty. Most studies utilize laboratory-based, within-subjects designs, often with convenience samples of young adults, which may limit generalizability and ecological validity.\n\nDespite these advances, significant research gaps remain. Notably, there is a paucity of studies directly examining the combined effects of sleep deprivation and uncertainty on decision making, and few have systematically manipulated or measured individual differences in uncertainty tolerance. The existing literature lacks theoretical integration and methodological rigor in operationalizing uncertainty within sleep deprivation paradigms. Furthermore, diverse populations and real-world decision contexts are underrepresented, highlighting the need for future research to address these limitations and elucidate the mechanisms by which sleep deprivation influences decision making under uncertainty.",
